All I want is a JSON parsing library for haskell that has a straightforward
API, and basically just fucking works. Is that so much to ask?

FAQ

  - Are you sure you don't want to make a representation of ALL of the json
    you're parsing BEFORE using any of it?
    
    Yes, quite sure.
  
  - Don't you think you'd look a lot smarter if your API obfuscated the very
    simple act of just parsing some fucking json, to the point where you don't
    really understand what the fuck is going on and are just happy that it
    works?
    
    I am really funny.
  
  - Didn't you get that memo about making sure that real world application of
    haskell is forbidden by the glorious chairman?
    
    W-what? Oh shit I have to go, I'll see you in mexico.
